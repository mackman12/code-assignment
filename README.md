# Getting Started

The "assignment" folder contains the backend built on Java and Spring.

To run the backend application, simply use "gradle Bootrun" in your command prompt when you're in the "assignment" directory (the backend will, and have to, run on port 8080).

The "service-checker" folder contains the react frontend.

To run the frontend, install node modules by using "npm install" within the "service-checker" directory, after node modules are installed, use "npm start" (the frontend will, and have to run on port 3000).

## Requirements

Gradle, npm and Java 11 +
